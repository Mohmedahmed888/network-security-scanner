# Screenshots

Place your application screenshots here.

## How to add screenshots:

1. Take a screenshot of your application
2. Save it in this folder (e.g., `main-window.png`, `scan-results.png`)
3. Update the main README.md to reference the images

## Example image names:
- `main-window.png` - Main application window
- `scan-results.png` - Scan results view
- `vulnerability-report.png` - Vulnerability detection results
